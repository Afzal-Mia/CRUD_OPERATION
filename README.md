# CRUD Operations - Full Stack Application

Welcome to my CRUD Operations app, where I showcase my skills by performing **Create**, **Read**, **Update**, and **Delete** operations using **React** on the frontend and **Node.js/Express** on the backend. 

This app is designed to demonstrate basic CRUD operations on a list of employees.

### **Features:**
- **Create:** Add new employees to the list.
- **Read:** View a list of all employees.
- **Update:** Edit employee details.
- **Delete:** Remove an employee from the list.

### **Tech Stack:**
- **Frontend:** React, Vite, Axios, Bootstrap
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, MongoDB
- **Database:** MongoDB (using Mongoose for ORM)
