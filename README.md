# CRUD Operations - Full Stack Application 🚀

Welcome to my **CRUD Operations** app, where I showcase my skills by performing **Create**, **Read**, **Update**, and **Delete** operations using **React** on the frontend and **Node.js/Express** on the backend. 🌐

This app is designed to demonstrate basic CRUD operations on a list of employees. 💼

### **Features** 🔧:

- **Read:** 📑 View a list of all employees.
- **Update:** ✍️ Edit employee details.
- **Delete:** ❌ Remove an employee from the list.

### **Tech Stack** 🛠️:
- **Frontend:** React, Vite, Axios, Bootstrap
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, MongoDB
